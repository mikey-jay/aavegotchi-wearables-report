# Aaavegotchi Wearables Market Dashboard

This dashboard was commissioned by the Aavegotchi DAO so that the Wearables Task Force (WTF) and other constituents can make well informed, data-driven decisions about future wearables emissions and other related matters. The following sections are available:

* Volume - Bazaar sales volume for wearables
* Prices - Median sale prices and market capitalization
* Supply - Available supply and trait distribution
* Usage - Equipping of wearables for rarity farming

## Deploying the Code
The code is ready-made to be run with [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/), [Voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), and is pre-configured to deploy directly to [Heroku](heroku.com).
